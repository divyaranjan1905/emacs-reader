#+TITLE: Part III: Multi-Threading
* Core Refactoring & Additional Formats

+   *Render Core Refactor:* The biggest architectural shift is the move from a ~render-pdf~ specific system to a more general ~render-core~. This aims to support multiple document formats beyond PDF.
+   *C/Elisp Separation:* A clear separation of concerns between C and Elisp code was implemented. Many helper functions were moved from C to Elisp, improving maintainability.
+   =PdfState->DocState=: A ~DocState~ struct was introduced to hold document-related information, centralizing  state management.

* Scrolling & Navigation

+   *Extensive Scrolling Improvements:* A huge amount of work went into scrolling functionality:
    *   *Screenful Scrolling:* Added screenful scrolling (scrolling by pages/screens).
    *   *Continuous Scrolling:* Implemented continuous scrolling.
    *   *Keybindings:* Added numerous keybindings for scrolling (up, down, page up, page down, continuous scrolling).
    *   *Scrollable Functions:* Added optional amount arguments to scroll functions.
    *   *Edge Case Handling:* Fixed edge cases in page navigation and scrolling.
    *   *Scroll to Bottom:* Fixed scrolling to the bottom of the previous page.
    *   *Scroll Up/Down Functionality* Added functionality to scroll pages up and down.
+   *Page Navigation:* Improved page navigation and handling, including centering after navigation.

*  Scaling & Zooming

+   *Scaling Factor Management:* Implemented proper scaling factor management, storing it within the ~DocState~.
+   *Zoom Support:* Added basic zoom support.
+   *Window Resizing:* The window size is now adjusted to match the ~read-pdf-mode~ one.
+   *Consistent Scaling:* Scaling is now consistent when changing pages.

* Documentation & Code Quality

+   *Extensive Documentation:* Added documentation to many C and Elisp functions.
  +   *Code Style:* Improved code style with indentation and consistent naming schemes.
+   *Error Handling:* Improved error handling in module functions.
+   *CONTRIBUTORS File:* Updated the CONTRIBUTORS file format and
added contributors.

*  Build System & Dependencies

+   *Makefile:* Updated the Makefile to rely on the in-tree
~emacs-module.h~.
+ Made the build be cross-platform.

* Integration with Emacs

+ Added feature to save pages of document from native Emacs boomarks.
+ Added feature to save the page when Emacs was closed and reopen it (=saveplace=).

* What Lies Ahead for v0.3.0

+ Lay the foundations for multi-threading in the backend.
+ Work on persistent errors in centering of the page and scrolling.
+ Make the package ready for ELPA:
  + Remove the submodule as distributions package latest MuPDF.
  + Copyright assignments
+ Tentative features:
  + Basic text selection and search support
  + Table of Contents with =imenu= integration.
